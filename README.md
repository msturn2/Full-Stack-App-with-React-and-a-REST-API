# *Full Stack App with React and a REST API*
In my capstone, l use React to create a client for your existing school database REST API (that you created in a previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
